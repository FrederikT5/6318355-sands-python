# 6318355-sands-python
This project is apart of the Signals and Systems (AESB2122-24) course. 

- You will find 2 primary Python files in this repo. signals.py contains functions to generate and modify signals. The other, script.py runs these functions, plots the results, and saves the plots. It includes sine, unit step, and unit impulse signals, along with operations such as time-shifting, time-scaling, and signal addition.

- This project also includes tests to verify the functionality and accuracy of the signals and operations functions.
